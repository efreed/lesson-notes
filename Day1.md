Day 1, introduce "documents", “programs”, and "markup"
===============================================

(Day 1 is designed for a computer lab with Windows PCs)




"documents"

Sports.. at the end of a game the scores are "documented"

Anytime you write something, you are recording information. That is a document.

When you write in your notebook tonight's math homework, you are making a document.

That night when you get a piece of paper and write out the math problems, you've made another document.

When you turn in your math, you are moving your document from your folder to your teacher's folder.

Computers are used to make electronic documents.  
There are many TYPES of electronic documents.

And sometimes a different program is used to edit a document.

(Open samples) .. videos, photos, songs, book reports..

But what happens if you have a document, but not the program?

(Open made up file type)  it won't run because it needs a program


“the first web page”

The “situation was difficult” because not everyone had the same programs.

(Look at many file types in Notepad)


Tim Berners-Lee wanted people to use the SIMPLEST type of document so MANY programs and computers could read it.


Let’s make our first web page.

(An easy to type, two line sample, save as “hi.html”)
“My name is Mr. Teacher. 
I like cinnamon rolls.”

(Introduce “Markup”)

<u> <br> and <h1> <b>



Notes for next year
===================
While “opening notepad, saving with an html extension, and opening the file in a browser is something I do all the time”, those were each really big steps.  And the concept of having two apps open at the same time is a first for most kids.

Opening Notepad
 - Click Start, select All Programs (“All programs where?”)
 - Select Accessories (can be tricky moving the mouse cursor straight right to the next sub menu)
 - Click on Notepad (one computer didn’t have it!)
Maybe next year, have them press Win+R to open the run dialog an type notepad and press enter.

Saving with an html extension.
 - Click File, select Save (“Save or Save As?” was a common question, save works better)
 - But it defaults to My Documents, click Desktop (1 out of 5 needed help with clicking desktop on the left)
 - Change the *.txt file name field to “page.html”  (1 in 7 typed “page. html” which wound up saving as “page. html.txt”)
 - Click Save
 - “Minimize” notepad (this didn’t cause any questions, but a few students closed it instead of minimize)

Open in the browser
 - Find the icon on the desktop (some have an IE icon, some FF, some Chrome, some desktops are just cluttered, I had to click on the desktop and type “p” until it highlighted.. and the “page. html.txt” files, now have to be deleted and do save as in notepad)

Go back to notepad
 - “look for a notepad button in the bottom start bar”  click it. (and help the students that closed notepad)

Introduce <u> and </u>
 - a slide with those two and arrows pointing saying “start underlining” for one and “stop underlining” for the other would be helpful to leave showing on the board.
 - “It’s not working” a few students would say as they are typing in notepad.. I suppose they were expecting an underline to appear in notepad.

Save and go back to the browser
 - and click refresh.. which is in a different location depending on the default browser for that PC
