Day 1, introduce "documents", “programs”, and "markup"
===============================================

(Day 1 is designed for a computer lab with Windows PCs)




"documents"

Sports.. at the end of a game the scores are "documented"

Anytime you write something, you are recording information. That is a document.

When you write in your notebook tonight's math homework, you are making a document.

That night when you get a piece of paper and write out the math problems, you've made another document.

When you turn in your math, you are moving your document from your folder to your teacher's folder.

Computers are used to make electronic documents.  
There are many TYPES of electronic documents.

And sometimes a different program is used to edit a document.

(Open samples) .. videos, photos, songs, book reports..

But what happens if you have a document, but not the program?

(Open made up file type)  it won't run because it needs a program


“the first web page”

The “situation was difficult” because not everyone had the same programs.

(Look at many file types in Notepad)


Tim Berners-Lee wanted people to use the SIMPLEST type of document so MANY programs and computers could read it.


Let’s make our first web page.

(An easy to type, two line sample, save as “hi.html”)
“My name is Mr. Teacher. 
I like cinnamon rolls.”

(Introduce “Markup”)
