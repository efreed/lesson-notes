Day 1, introduce "documents", "applications", and "markup"
===============================================

(Day 1 is designed for a computer lab with Windows PCs)




"documents"

Sports.. at the end of a game the scores are "documented"

Anytime you write something, you are recording information. That is a document.

When you write in your notebook tonight's math homework, you are making a document.

That night when you get a piece of paper and write out the math problems, you've made another doucument.

When you turn in your math, you are moving your document from your folder to your teacher's folder.

Computers are used to make electronic documents.  There are many TYPES of electronic documents.  Notice that documents require an application to read them.  And sometimes a different application to write them.

(Open samples) .. videos, photos, songs, book reports..

(Open made up file type)  it won't run because it needs an Application
